You get an English texts where the spaces between words were removed. The task is to use Bayessian inference
to bring the spaces back in a completely unsupervised way. The task is relevant e.g. for Chinese, Japanese,
Thai, or other languages not separating words. English was chosen so that everyone could see how good his/her
results are. You can find all necesary information in Kewin Knight's tutorial "Bayessian inference with tears"
(https://www.isi.edu/natural-language/people/bayes-with-tears.pdf). Try several hyperparameter combination to
gain as good results as possible. Try also the simulated annealing method to delay the Gibbs sampling
convergence. 
Please, send me your code (prefered language is Python) together with the output text file by email to
marecek@ufal.mff.cuni.cz.
